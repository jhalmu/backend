## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not create a public issue**. Instead, report it confidentially using GitHub Security Advisories:

👉 [Open a Security Advisory](https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>/security/advisories/new)

Please include as much detail as possible:
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions
- Impact assessment

We aim to respond to all reports within 3 business days. After initial assessment, we will work with you on a fix and coordinate public disclosure.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters if desired.

## Found a bug or have an idea? 🐛💡

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or notice something odd, **please open an issue on GitHub!**

👉 [Open an issue](https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>/issues/new/choose)

We welcome all feedback and contributions! 🙏
